__Escornabot__ is an open source educational robotics project. It aims to
introduce children into robotics and programming. The basic _Escornabot_ can
execute secuencies of movements that are programmed by the user pushing the
robot's buttons. 

More advanced versions are featured with remote commands from a mobile device
with Bluetooth connection. We are [cooking tons of ideas to implement][ROA01]
following a development based in the concepts of simplicity, modular and cheap.

It is an [OSHW project][OSH01], so development is opened to the community and
anybody (including yourself) who can contribute to its evolution. If you wish
to give some love to this project, in the shape of new features, redesigns,
documentation or whatever, [we'll be happy to read your ideas and
suggestions][CON01].
